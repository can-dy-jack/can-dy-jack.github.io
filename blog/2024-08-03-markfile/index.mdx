## First contact with make
When I was invited for my first job interview in the IT, I’ve been asked such question:

> How would you typically build a program from sources, what commands will you use?

I answered:

> It’s obvious:
> ```markfiles
> ./configure
> make
> make install
> ```

Those times belong to the past now and nowadays not many programmers use GNU Make[^1]. Try asking this question and you will see disgust at best.

For many it’s the fist contact with make and often the last one, but not for me 😉

[^1]: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/

{/* truncate */}

## What `make` does?

Let build a base line. `make` orchestrates tasks based on dependencies, executing commands to generate target files and keep them up to date efficiently. It streamlines software compilation and project management.

As simple as it is, it does few things pretty well:

- detects changes in files (source -> binary),
- manages dependencies,
- manages default values for variables much easier than Bash,
- allows to build in parallel,
- OS detection,
- on my system binary is only 16kB in size,
- is available on any OS,
- and much more!

## My second contact with make - Postfix

The second non obvious use of `make` I stood, was the way to refresh Postfix’s map files. 
With Postfix servers, you’ve been usually writing a bunch of text files like `aliases`, `transports`, etc, 
which have to be indexed to the binary Berkley DB format.

```makefile title="/etc/postfix/main.cf"
alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases
```

To “generate” Berkley DB file you have to run:

```makefile title="Generate aliases database"
postalias aliases
```

Which was producing `aliases.db` file.
 Other types of files required to use `postmap` command to generate them.

The more complicated the Postfix configuration, the more files you had. 
If you missed to update one of map files,
 your configuration wasn’t effective and you could spend hours debugging: 
 why this f… alias do not work?

That’s where `make` comes handy[^2]. You can just drop the file like this:

[^2]: https://www.postfix.org/DATABASE_README.html 

```makefile title="cat Makefile"
.PHONY: reload

all: aliases.db access.db virtual.db reload

aliases.db: aliases
    postalias aliases

access.db: access
    postmap access

virtual.db: virtual
    postmap virtual

reload:
    postfix reload
```

Let me explain what happens here.

1. `.PHONY: reload`: This line declares the target `reload` as a phony target[^3]. 
Phony targets are ones that do not represent actual files. 
This is typically used for targets that don’t produce output files, such as clean, all, etc. 
It ensures that even if a file named `reload` exists in the directory, the `reload` target will still be executed.

2. `all: aliases.db access.db virtual.db reload`: This line specifies that when you run `make all`, 
it will generate the files `aliases.db`, `access.db`, and `virtual.db`, and then execute the `reload` target. 
As `all` target is the default, it’s enough to just run `make`.

3. `aliases.db`: aliases: This line specifies that `aliases.db` depends on the file `aliases`. 
If `aliases` file is newer than `aliases.db` or `aliases.db` doesn’t exist, the commands listed below will be executed.

4. `postalias aliases`: This line is the command to generate the `aliases.db` file from the `aliases` file 
using the `postalias` command. `postalias` is a command used in Postfix to create or update the alias database.

5. Similarly, `access.db`: access and `virtual.db: virtual` are rules to generate `access.db` and `virtual.db` files 
from `access` and `virtual` files respectively using the `postmap` command.

6. `reload:`: This line declares the `reload` target. When you run `make reload`, it will execute the command listed below.

7. `postfix reload`: This line is the command to reload the Postfix service. It tells Postfix to reload its configuration, applying any changes that may have been made.

[^3]: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html 


Summing up, when you run `make`, it will generate or update the necessary database files 
for Postfix configuration (`aliases.db`, `access.db`, `virtual.db`) 
and then reload the Postfix service.

Now you won’t make mistakes again.

I know that today many of you would say: “just use Ansible dude!” 
But at that time, there was no Ansible yet. 
I didn’t use this pattern for years now, so let check more up to date usage examples.

## Use of `make` in Python projects
I love Python for it’s simplicity… at least when it comes to coding, 
because when you start managing dependencies, it’s getting tricky. 
What do you use: raw `dependencies.txt` or rather [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)  or [Pipenv ](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) ? 
Do you use system Python or maybe [pyenv ](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) ?

My answer: it depends 😃

For simple projects, I usually just use `pip`. 
Sometimes even without `requirements.txt` files, 
just listing in the README what to install. 
But the more projects I wrote, the harder it is to remember how to test them. 
Again, that’s where Make comes handy.


```makefile title="Simple Makefile for Python projects"
.PHONY: requirements test

.venv:
    python3 -m venv .venv

requirements:
    source .venv/bin/activate && \
        python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && \
        python3 -m pip install pytest

test: .venv requirements dev-requirements
    source .venv/bin/activate && \
        pytest
```

What happens here?

1. `.PHONY: requirements test`: Declares `requirements` and `test` as phony targets to ensure they are always executed regardless of file existence.

2. `.venv:`: Creates a Python virtual environment named `.venv` if it doesn’t already exist.

3. `requirements:`: Installs Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` into the virtual environment created earlier. Additionally, it installs the `pytest` package globally.

4. `test: .venv requirements dev-requirements`: Sets up dependencies for testing, including the virtual environment and specified requirements. Then, it activates the virtual environment and runs the tests using `pytest`.

Alternative config for Poetry, might look more or less like that:

```makefile title="Simple Makefile for Python projects"
.PHONY: requirements test

requirements:
    poetry install

test: requirements
    poetry run pytest
```

When I see `Makefile` in a Python project, I can blindly run `make test` and it will do what I expect -> run tests. 
Whatever it requires to configure or run, it will just happen.

## `make` in Terraform projects
Similar situation to Python, I have with [Terraform ](https://www.terraform.io/) projects. In simple project you just need:

```makefile title="Typical Terraform flow"
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

But what if you use different accounts for PROD and DEV environments? 
What if you need to fetch latest version of modules?

I have a `Makefile` for this too.

```makefile title="Terraform Makefile" showLineNumbers
.PHONY: init
SHELL=/bin/bash

# those variables you should initialize outside of this script
# and export, Make will just set then based on what you will
# have set in your environment. You can use for eg. `aws sts`
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ?=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ?=
AWS_REGION ?= "us-west-2"

# dev by default
ENVIRONMENT ?= dev
STATE_FILE_BUCKET ?= s3-bucket-$(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)-$(ENVIRONMENT)-terraform-state
STATE_FILE_KEY ?= state/some_service/$(ENVIRONMENT)/terraform.tfstate

# make some variable available in Terraform
export TF_VAR_something ?= something1
export TF_VAR_something_else ?= something-else

.terraform:
    terraform init \
		-reconfigure \
		-backend-config='key=$(STATE_FILE_KEY)' \
		-backend-config='bucket=$(STATE_FILE_BUCKET)' \
		-var-file=environments/$(ENVIRONMENT)/variables.tfvars \
		-out terraform.plan

	terraform get

# this will switch Terraform version to the one that your project needs
# https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv
init: .terraform
	tfenv install

plan: init
    terraform plan

apply: plan
    terraform apply \
		-auto-approve \
		terraform.plan

destroy:
    terraform destroy \
		-auto-approve \
		-var-file=environments/$(ENVIRONMENT)/variables.tfvars

dev-plan: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=dev-key
dev-plan: plan

dev-apply: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=dev-key
dev-apply: apply

dev-destroy: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=dev-key
dev-destroy: destroy

prod-plan: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=prod-key
prod-plan: plan

prod-apply: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=prod-key
prod-apply: apply

clean:
    @rm -rf .terraform/modules
    @rm -f terraform.*
```

This file expects a directory structure like

```bash title="Directory structure"
$ tree example/
.
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── provider.tf
├── backend.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── ...
├── environments/
│   ├── dev
│   │   ├── variables.tfars
│   ├── prod/
│   │   ├── variables.tfars
│   ├── .../
```

Backends configuration in the `backend.tf` file can be just basic:

```tf title="backend.tf"
terraform {
	backend "s3" {
		region = "us-west-2"
		encrypt = true
	}
}
```

Rest of parameters are provided in the Makefile - 
it’s called partial backend configuration[^4]. 
This configuration allows me to use same codebase for all the environments. 
All customizations have to be listed as variables in `variables.tfvars` files. 
It can be easily extended to suport 4 or 6 environments and the only think I need to remember is:


[^4]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration#partial-configuration

```makefile
make dev-plan
make dev-apply
```

## make for `Hugo` blogging

Even for blogging with Hugo I have a `Makefile`[^5] that I use across multiple sites. 
It’s simplifying some of the steps, that I won’t need to remember them.

## Summary

There are many creative ways to use `Makefiles` to automate and simplify daily tasks. 
Tool is small and simple, available on any platform (even on Windows via WSL or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) ). 
Many of my colleagues considered this tool an “old school” or “obsolete” initially, 
but they eventually fall under impression of the recipes simplicity and now just replicate them all around.

I hope, I will also impress you 😉 Good luck and happy automating!
